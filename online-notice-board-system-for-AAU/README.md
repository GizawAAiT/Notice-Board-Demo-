        - these offices can create,delete and update notices as requred 
    
    2   - students and other staffs of the university can see the notices and anouncements by joining the specific notice board they want 
        - students can join or leave any notice board 
        - as aresult the students and other members of the specific notice board will have updated information 
    
    3   - any office which wants to create and deploy notice board need to create account and and log in into the platform we will create
